<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
    Hello! I'm Ismail Irfan, a versatile professional with a skill set that spans back-end data handling, UI/UX design, and social platform management. Based in Karachi, I bring a strong background in UI/UX and Wordpress development to the table.
</p>
<p>
    My passion lies in seamlessly blending back-end functionality with intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces. I excel in handling back-end data to ensure robust and efficient systems. In addition to my technical expertise, I have a keen interest in Mobile Application development, where I can leverage my design skills to create engaging user experiences.

<p>
    Beyond development, I am adept at fostering relationships across various social platforms. I understand the importance of a cohesive online presence and enjoy creating connections that enhance brand visibility and engagement.
